    <h1>Security Threats Guidelines:</h1>
    <p>Security threats, such as bomb threats, suspicious packages, or threatening behavior, can pose risks to the safety and well-being of library patrons, staff, and volunteers. The following steps outline the recommended response procedure in the event of a security threat: </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        <ul class="indented-list">
            <li><strong>Assess the situation:</strong> Quickly determine the nature and severity of the security threat. Gather as much information as possible without putting yourself or others in danger. 
            </li>
                <li><strong>Call 911:</strong> If you believe the threat is credible and poses an immediate danger, call 911 to report the situation. Provide the library's address and a description of the threat. Follow any instructions provided by the dispatcher. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>Notify the library director and other library management:</strong> Inform the library director and designated emergency coordinator(s) of the situation, providing details about the threat and any potential impacts on library operations. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>Communicate with patrons, staff, and volunteers:</strong> If necessary, inform library patrons, staff, and volunteers of the security threat and any required safety precautions or adjustments to normal library operations. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>Evacuate the building if appropriate:</strong> If the threat warrants an evacuation, guide patrons, staff, and volunteers to the nearest exit, using designated evacuation routes. Assist individuals with disabilities or those who require additional support. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>Assemble at the designated meeting point:</strong> Once outside the building, gather at the predetermined meeting point. This location should be a safe distance from the library and away from any emergency vehicle access routes. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>Conduct a headcount:</strong> Library staff should conduct a headcount to ensure that all patrons, staff, and volunteers have evacuated the building. Notify emergency responders if anyone is missing or unaccounted for. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cooperate with law enforcement and emergency responders:</strong> Work closely with law enforcement and emergency responders as they investigate the security threat and determine the appropriate course of action. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>Do not re-enter the building until cleared by authorities:</strong> Remain outside the building until law enforcement or emergency responders declare it safe to return. Do not attempt to re-enter the building for any reason until given the all-clear. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>Document the incident:</strong> After the security threat is resolved and the situation is under control, document the details of the incident, including the nature of the threat, actions taken, and any injuries or property damage. This information will be used for incident reports, insurance claims, and identifying areas for improvement in the library's emergency response procedures. 
        </li>
