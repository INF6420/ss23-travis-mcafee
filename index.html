    <h1>General Response Guidelines:</h1>
    <p>While each emergency situation may require specific actions, there are some general guidelines that library staff should follow when responding to any emergency. These general response guidelines serve as a foundation for effective decision-making and action during various emergency scenarios.</p>

        <ul class="indented-list">
            <li><strong>Stay calm:</strong> Maintaining a calm demeanor is crucial in any emergency. Remaining calm helps you think clearly and make better decisions, and it also reassures others, promoting a more orderly response. </li>
            
            <li><strong>Assess the situation:</strong> Quickly evaluate the nature and severity of the emergency. Determine if immediate action is required, such as evacuating the building or calling for help. </li>
        
            <li><strong>Prioritize safety:</strong> Always prioritize the safety of people, including patrons, staff, and volunteers, over protecting library property or resources. Evacuate the building, provide first aid, or take other necessary actions to ensure the well-being of everyone involved. </li>
        
            <li><strong>Follow established procedures:</strong> Adhere to the emergency response procedures outlined in this manual, as well as any instructions provided by local authorities or emergency services. </li>
        
            <li><strong>Communicate effectively:</strong> Keep patrons, staff, and volunteers informed of the situation and any necessary actions. Use clear, concise language, and avoid causing panic or confusion. </li>
        
            <li><strong>Work as a team:</strong> Coordinate with fellow staff members to ensure a cohesive and effective response. Assign tasks based on individual skills and responsibilities, and provide support as needed. </li>
        
            <li><strong>Adapt to the situation:</strong> Be prepared to modify your response as the situation evolves. Emergencies can be unpredictable, and it is essential to remain flexible and adapt to changing circumstances. </li>
        
            <li><strong>Document the incident:</strong> Once the emergency is under control, record the details of the incident, including the nature of the emergency, actions taken, and any injuries or property damage. This information will be used for incident reports, insurance claims, and identifying areas for improvement in the library's emergency response procedures.</li>
