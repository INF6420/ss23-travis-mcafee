    <h1>Medical Emergencies Guidelines:</h1>
    <p>Medical emergencies can occur at any time and may involve patrons, staff, or volunteers. It is essential to act quickly and efficiently to provide assistance and secure professional medical help when needed. The following steps outline the recommended response procedure in the event of a medical emergency: </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        <ul class="indented-list">
            <li><strong>Assess the situation:</strong> Quickly assess the nature and severity of the medical emergency. Determine if the person is conscious, breathing, and responsive. 
            </li>
                <li><strong>Call for help:</strong> If the situation is severe or life-threatening, call 911 immediately. Provide the library's address and a description of the medical emergency. Follow the dispatcher's instructions and stay on the line until help arrives. 
            </li>  
                <li><strong>Administer first aid:</strong> If you are trained in first aid or CPR, administer appropriate care within the scope of your training. Do not attempt to provide medical care beyond your knowledge or capabilities. 
            </li>
                <li><strong>Designate a staff member or volunteer to assist:</strong> Assign someone to meet emergency responders at the entrance to guide them to the location of the medical emergency. This will help save time and ensure the responders can provide assistance as quickly as possible. 
            </li>
                <li><strong>Clear the area:</strong> Ensure that the area around the person experiencing the medical emergency is clear of patrons and unnecessary obstacles. This will allow emergency responders to work more efficiently and provide privacy for the individual in distress. 
            </li>
                <li><strong>Notify the library director and other library management:</strong> Inform the library director and designated emergency coordinator(s) of the situation as soon as it is safe to do so. They will coordinate with emergency medical services and determine any further actions required. 
            </li>
                <li><strong>Document the incident:</strong> After the situation is under control and the individual has received appropriate care, document the details of the incident, including the nature of the medical emergency, actions taken, and the response by emergency medical services. This information will be used for incident reports and identifying areas for improvement in the library's emergency response procedures. 
                </li>
                </ul>
